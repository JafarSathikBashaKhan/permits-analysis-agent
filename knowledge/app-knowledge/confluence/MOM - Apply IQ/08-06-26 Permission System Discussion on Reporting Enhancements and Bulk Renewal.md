### Clarifications by Joanne Archer

-   Payment method **should not impact renewal initiation**. [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3sTw4jyAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
    
-   Renewal follows standard flow:
    
    1.  Submit → Pending Approval
        
    2.  Approval
        
    3.  Payment processing [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3sTw4jyAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        

### Southend-Specific Context

    -   No payments [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3sTw4jyAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
