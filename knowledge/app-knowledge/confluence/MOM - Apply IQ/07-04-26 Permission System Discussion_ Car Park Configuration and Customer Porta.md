[\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)

        -   Address (postcode, street, town)
            
        -   Bay types (e.g., resident, disabled, EV) [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
            
        -   Number of bays
            
        -   Availability
            
        -   On-street/off-street indicator

-   **Bay types clarification:**
    
    -   Should be practical (e.g., resident, disabled, EV)
        
    -   Some car parks may not require specific bay types (generic parking allowed) [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        
-   **Map functionality:**
    
    -   Optional (toggle-based)
        
    -   Requires address data for plotting

### **2.2 Car Park Availability & Capacity**

-   Availability tracking is **configurable (optional)**. [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
    
-   Two scenarios:
    
    -   **Restricted model:** Stop selection when capacity is reached
        
    -   **Non-restricted model:** Allow oversubscription (first-come, first-served usage pattern) [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        
-   Real-time availability:
    
    -   Should update dynamically if enabled
        
    -   Prevent selection when full (only if restriction is enabled) [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)

### **2.3 Permission & Car Park Mapping**

-   Car parks are:
    
    -   Configured at contract level
        
    -   **Mapped to permissions** during setup [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        
-   During application:
    
    -   User selects a permission
        
    -   System allows selection of associated car park(s)
        
    -   Selection depends on availability (if configured) [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)

### **2.4 Vehicle Configuration**

-   Multiple vehicles can be linked to a permit (based on builder configuration). [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)

-   Flow behavior:
    
    -   **Multiple car parks:** Show search/map selection screen
        
    -   **Single car park:** Skip selection and directly navigate to application page [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        
-   Existing application flow remains unchanged:
    
    -   Only car park selection step is new
        
    -   Reuse existing car park permit template [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)

### **2.7 Suspension Extension – Key Decisions**

#### **Extension Behavior**

-   Users can:
    
    -   Extend suspension by entering number of days/weeks
        
    -   Switch duration type if allowed in permission configuration [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        
-   Start date:
    
    -   Auto-populated from parent application end date
        
    -   Not editable
        
    -   Time is editable [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        

* * *

#### **Workflow Updates**

-   Revised flow:
    
    1.  Approved
        
    2.  Waiting for Payment (if applicable)
        
    3.  Print (for signage)
        
    4.  Assign Task to CEO [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        
-   Printing step is mandatory before assigning task (to generate signs). [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
    

* * *

#### **Auto-Cancellation Logic**

-   If **payment NOT completed** and parent application expires → Auto-cancel extension
    
-   If **payment completed** → Do NOT cancel extension even if parent expires [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
    

* * *

#### **Reference Number Handling**

-   Extension creates a **new reference number**
    
-   Cross-referencing:
    
    -   Parent stores extension reference
        
    -   Extension stores parent reference
        
-   Search:
    
    -   System supports search using extension reference number [\[Permission...on with Jo | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADRhODcwMTc5LWU5MmItNDcwYy05MzIzLWE0MzNmZmM5YmViYgFRAAgI3pQ4nKAAAEYAAAAA8Yjw7HkDgkGw78Fblge0OgcAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgAAAAABDQAAkdj41iWNBEKgL1IpqCBSmgABjJCOoQAAEA%3d%3d)
        

* * *

## **3\. Decisions**

-   Car park availability must be **configurable (optional restriction)**
    
-   Map-based selection to be **toggle-driven**
    
-   Existing permit template will be reused (no new application page)
    
-   Printing step to be introduced **before task assignment** in suspension flow
    
-   Extension auto-cancellation depends on **payment status**
